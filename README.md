# Economic Impact of Federal Reserve Speecxhes


The Federal Reserve is responsible for setting short term interest rates and controlling the money supply in an attempt to keep inflation and unemployment within an acceptable range. Speeches and press releases by Federal Reserve Board members may provide insights into the Fed's future actions and have an impact on current interest rates.

Before the financial crisis of 2009, the Federal Reserve was very secretive about monetary policy. The minutes of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, the committee responsible for setting short term interest rates and changing the supply of money in the economy, were not released until weeks after the meetings took place. News organizations would speculate about the outcome of the FOMC meetings based on the size of Alan Greenspan’s, the then Federal Reserve Board Chairman briefcase. If the leather briefcase was packed with papers and appeared full, the media concluded the FOMC had made a change to economic policy. If the briefcase was thin, there would be no changes to the money supply.

The language of the speeches made by FOMC members was also very vague and hard to decipher. Chairman Greenspan’s warned that equity markets were exhibiting ‘irrational exuberance’, rather than simply state that they were overvalued. Careers were made deciphering ‘Fed Speek’ language into expectations of policy outcomes.

As a result of the financial crisis and under the leadership of Chairman Ben Bernanke and then Chairman Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve began to be more transparent with the actions taken by the FOMC both in terms of the language used to discuss the economy and the timing of information being released. FOMC committee meeting minutes are now released at the end of the day the meetings take place. 

I wanted to investigate whether Federal Reserve Board Members’ speeches and the FOMC press releases had an impact on the future direction of interest rates.

As further motivation for this study, the chart below shows the 5-year and 10-year Treasury yield during 2013. Going into 2013 the Federal Reserve had been increasing the supply of money in the economy by purchasing bonds in the open market. This was done to keep long term interest rates low in an effort to spur business investment. The vertical line represents the date Chairman Bernanke made a comment that the Federal Reserve would ‘taper’ (slow down) the rate of bond purchases in the future. The bond markets reacted to this comment by selling bonds causing interest rates to increase over the following months. This reaction by the bond market is referred to as the ‘taper tantrum’. What is interesting to note is that the Federal Reserve did not change their policy at the time of the speech, but the market’s expectations changed.
